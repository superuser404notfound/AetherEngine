## [Unreleased]

_Nothing yet._

## [2.1.1] — 2026-05-31

`FrameExtractor` quality pass. Internal only, no public API change, existing 2.1.0 callers are unaffected.

- **HDR thumbnails tone-map correctly.** PQ (ST 2084) and HLG stills used to render too dark / desaturated because the extractor scaled straight to sRGB with no transfer conversion. HDR frames now route through a zscale + tonemap libavfilter graph (BT.2020 PQ/HLG to SDR BT.709 RGBA, hable tone curve); SDR keeps the direct sws path. Requires the avfilter + zimg FFmpegBuild (already pinned).
- **Faster, lighter remote extraction.** A `.stillExtraction` demuxer profile gives the extractor's AVIO a random-access shape: no read-ahead prefetch (which a scrub discards on the next seek and which competed with playback bandwidth), a 1 MB seek chunk, and a small probe budget. Plus decode fast-flags (skip loop filter, fast decode).
- **Fix: thumbnails on sparse-keyframe HEVC.** The thumbnail decode no longer sets `skip_frame = NONKEY`, which starved the decoder when a seek landed mid-GOP past a lone keyframe (nil thumbnail on some HEVC sources).

Known limitation: DV Profile 5 (IPT-PQ, no HDR10 base) thumbnails still have wrong colours on the software decode path, same class as the AV1 Profile 10.0 limitation. Full P5 playback is unaffected (native AVPlayer path).

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-31

New public API: `FrameExtractor`, off-playback still-image extraction. Produces `CGImage`s from a media URL through an FFmpeg decode context fully isolated from playback (no contact with the HLS loopback server or shared engine state). Two modes share one decode core: `thumbnail(at:maxWidth:)` snaps to the nearest keyframe and downscales (scrub previews, Recents lists), `snapshot(at:maxSize:)` decodes forward to the exact PTS at full resolution (user stills).

`FrameExtractor` is an `actor`: blocking FFmpeg work runs on a dedicated serial queue off the cooperative pool, the decode context opens lazily, a superseded request cancels the in-flight decode so the latest scrub position wins, results land in a bounded LRU cache (mode-isolated stores, second-bucketed thumbnails), and the context idle-closes after 10 s. `shutdown()` is the explicit permanent teardown that awaits release of the FFmpeg resources.

`AetherEngine.makeFrameExtractor()` vends an extractor for the currently loaded URL (carrying its HTTP headers); arbitrary items construct `FrameExtractor(url:httpHeaders:)` directly. The engine does not retain the returned extractor; the caller owns its lifecycle.

New `aetherctl extract` subcommand for still extraction + leak testing (`--at`, `--snapshot`, `--width`, `--loops`), backed by the same public API.

Minor bump: purely additive public API, no breaking changes. Existing 2.0.x callers compile and run unchanged.

## [2.0.2] — 2026-05-28

Follow-up bugfix to 2.0.1's Profile 5 work. The colr fix in 2.0.1 put the PQ transfer signal on the output sample entry but AVPlayer still failed the asset with `CoreMediaErrorDomain -4` because the source MP4's `hvcC` carried only the 22-byte configuration header (`numOfArrays = 0`) with VPS / SPS / PPS in-band on every IRAP packet. `CMVideoFormatDescription` cannot be built from a `dvh1` sample entry whose configuration record has no parameter set arrays. The matroska demuxer doesn't hit this because matroska parameter sets live in `CodecPrivate`, which FFmpeg lifts into `codecpar.extradata` as a complete annex-B sequence that the mp4 muxer's `ff_isom_write_hvcc` then rebuilds properly.

The fix scans the first IRAP packet for VPS / SPS / PPS NAL units, builds a proper hvcC byte sequence (header + 3 parameter set arrays), and replaces the output stream's `codecpar.extradata` before `avformat_write_header`. Gated on the precise signal: HEVC codec, extradata ≥ 23 B with byte 22 = 0, NALU length size 4.

Verified locally against the issue #19 sample: loopback playback advances in QuickTime / AVPlayer, init.mp4 has all four boxes (`dvh1` + `hvcC` 125 B with parameter sets + `colr nclx 9/16/9` + `dvcC` P5 L6 compat=0), colors render correctly.

## [2.0.1] — 2026-05-28

Bugfix release: Dolby Vision Profile 5 MP4 sources whose SPS VUI omits the transfer characteristic and whose container has no `colr` atom now play correctly. Previously the engine stream-copied the gap through to its output fMP4, so AVPlayer saw a `dvh1` sample entry with no PQ signal and refused to engage the DV decoder. The same content as MKV played fine because matroska's `Colour` element gives FFmpeg explicit `codecpar.color_*` that the mp4 muxer writes as a `colr nclx` atom; the mp4 demuxer has no equivalent fallback.

The fix forces the canonical P5 color tuple (BT.2020 / PQ / BT.2020-NCL / limited range) on the muxer's stream codecpar before `avformat_write_header`. P5 is defined as IPT-PQ-c2, so the `dvcC` record alone implies that signaling, which makes the override safe (no risk of mislabeling a non-PQ source).

Reported by @strangeliu (issue #19), diagnosed with @DrHurt's broken-vs-Dolby-reference framing.

## [2.0.0] — 2026-05-27

Stability milestone: the HDR / Dolby Vision routing path is now considered done after the DrHurt #4 sweep across multiple panel modes settled, and the adoption-readiness package (tests, CI, CHANGELOG, examples, Swift Package Index listing) makes the project safe to depend on. **No breaking changes to the public API surface** — existing 1.5.0 callers compile and run unchanged. The major version bump is a stability signal, not an API redesign.

Key user-visible changes since 1.5.0:

- **Match Dynamic Range OFF correctly detected.** tvOS exposes only one combined `isDisplayCriteriaMatchingEnabled` flag for Match Content (rate + range). Users with Match Frame Rate ON and Match Dynamic Range OFF previously had the engine route HDR sources through master playlists with `VIDEO-RANGE=PQ`, which AVPlayer rejected with -11848 / -11868 since the panel stayed in SDR. The engine now reads `UIScreen.currentEDRHeadroom` after the criteria handshake settles and uses that empirical reading for the master-vs-media routing decision.
- **`sourceVideoFormat` published.** Stats / debug overlays can now show "what's in the file" alongside "what the panel is presenting". A DV source on an HDR10-only TV now reads `sourceVideoFormat = .dolbyVision`, `videoFormat = .hdr10`.
- **LiveTelemetry + memory probe restart after audio-track switch.** Diagnostic samplers no longer go silent after the user picks a different audio track mid-session.
- **HLS producer reliability hardening.** Forward-scrub + back-scrub combinations no longer leave AVPlayer stuck waiting for evicted segments. The cache high-water reset moved AFTER the restart returns (was BEFORE, creating restart cascades). Proactive backward-jump restart applied to both `mediaSegmentURL` and `mediaSegment` (data) code paths.

Adoption-readiness additions:

- `Tests/AetherEngineTests/` with 12 unit tests covering pure-function surfaces.
- GitHub Actions CI runs `swift test` on macOS plus `xcodebuild` smoke builds for tvOS and iOS Simulators on every push and PR.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) as an in-repo release index.
- README › Stability and versioning documents the SemVer contract for adopters.
- README › Known limitations spells out the deferred / accepted-loss items so adopters can size them before integration.
- `Examples/MinimalPlayer/MinimalPlayerApp.swift` — a 90-line SwiftUI drop-in app demonstrating the smallest viable AetherEngine integration.
- `.spi.yml` for Swift Package Index multi-platform build matrix.

Internal:

- `resolveCodecRoute` extracted out of `HLSVideoEngine.start()`. The 300-line codec / DV dispatch switch is now a private function returning a `CodecRoute` struct. `start()` drops from ~830 to ~520 lines. Pure refactor, no behaviour change.

([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/2.0.0))

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-26

DV detection rewritten to read side-data before `color_trc` so DV Profile
8.4 (HLG base) and Profile 5 (often unspecified base-layer trc) enter the
DV branch. VP8 routed through the SW pipeline alongside VP9. MLP decoder
added to AudioBridge for BD-MV remuxes. New `aetherctl swdecode`
subcommand for reproducing SW-path issues locally. HLS producer restarts
cleanly on far-behind segment fetches. Display criteria preserved across
audio-track switches. EAC3+JOC auto-routes through the FLAC bridge on
Bluetooth A2DP / LE since Atmos passthrough is impossible over those
routes. ([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.5.0))

## [1.4.4] — 2026-05-26

Fixed `AVFoundationErrorDomain -11868` /
`AVErrorNoCompatibleAlternatesForExternalDisplay` on tvOS 26.5 for HDR /
DV sources (SDR was unaffected). Root cause: tvOS 26.5 enforces the
"criteria-before-load" ordering synchronously at HLS variant validation,
which AVKit-auto cannot satisfy for HLS multivariant HDR sources.
Engine-driven sole-writer is the only working pattern; hosts should set
`appliesPreferredDisplayCriteriaAutomatically = false` and pass
`LoadOptions(suppressDisplayCriteria: false)`. DV 8.1 / 8.4 emission
hardened: `hvc1` sample entry + `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS=dvh1.../db1p` on DV
panels, strip DV side data on non-DV panels.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.4))

## [1.4.2] — 2026-05-26

Live-stream scaffolding (`LoadOptions.isLive`, `@Published var isLive`,
`seek` becomes no-op when live). MPEG-4 Part 2 / MPEG-2 / VC-1 routed
through the SW pipeline. DV 8.1 emission now includes the `/db1p` brand
identifier on `SUPPLEMENTAL-CODECS` so AVPlayer's DV pipeline actually
engages. `DisplayCriteriaController.reset()` no-ops when no `apply()`
happened during the session, preventing nil-write races against AVKit's
in-flight criteria management.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.2))

## [1.4.1] — 2026-05-25

`waitForSwitch` Stage 1 grace extended from 200 ms to 1000 ms so AVKit's
async criteria write lands inside the gate. `play()` now waits for the
panel handshake to settle (initial load + audio-track-reload paths) so
DV / HDR cold-path first-frame stalls go away in AVKit-sole-writer hosts.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.1))

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-25

Added `LiveTelemetry` 1 Hz sampler for host stats overlays. Added
`FFmpegLogBridge` routing `av_log` output through `EngineLog`. Fixed
`waitForSwitch` async-handshake race that surfaced as AVPlayer -11848
"Cannot Open" on DV sources (the previous `isDisplayModeSwitchInProgress`
guard misclassified the setter's async window as "no switch needed").
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.4.0))

## [1.3.2] — 2026-05-23

DV Profile 7 (UHD-BD remuxes) now plays: routed as plain HEVC HDR10 with
the source `dvcC` stripped from the muxer output, so VT's HEVC selection
doesn't reject the sample entry with -12906. Resolved CDN URL cached
across range fetches (debrid / signed-URL proxies were paying the
redirect on every Range request, ~6 ops/sec at 4K HEVC). Engine logging
unified through `EngineLog`.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.2))

## [1.3.1] — 2026-05-23

Producer's empty-cache restart now fires after far scrubs (previous "wait
for cold-start" assumption stalled AVPlayer for 30 s on back-scrubs after
a forward scrub had moved the producer far away). DV Profile 5 routes
through the master playlist on HDR-ready non-DV panels (DV→HDR10
tonemap), and through the media playlist on SDR-locked panels (where
tvOS 26 rejects bare `dvh1.05` master with -11868). A/V gap reported in
the audio-gate-open log.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.1))

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-22

Audio bridge gained two modes: `.surroundCompat` (default, EAC3 per-channel
at 128 kbps, soundbar-compatible) and `.lossless` (FLAC up to 7.1, needs
multichannel-LPCM-capable AVR). `dec3` / `dac3` now built from packet
bitstream via the mp4 muxer's `+delay_moov` flag (no host-side
reconstruction). DV Profile 5 dispatch unified on `dvh1` sample entry +
`dvcC` regardless of panel, routing decides master vs media. Memory leaks
audited: URLSession task pool retention, subtitle cue accumulation,
periodic muxer recycle all root-caused.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.3.0))

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-17

Audio FLAC-bridge gate target rescaled into source TB (the prior
encoder-TB rescale ran 48× too far into source on DTS-HD MA sources,
producing 44 s A/V drift on cold start). MP3 routed through FLAC bridge
(AVPlayer reads any `mp4a` sample entry as AAC and rejects MP3 frames with
-11829). Embedded subtitle PTS origin documentation + matroska NOPTS
repair.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.2.0))

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-16

Three days of Sodalite public-beta feedback drove the A/V sync overhaul:
unconditional `AV_PKT_FLAG_KEY` video gate (initial-start as well as
restart), audio always waits for video gate, per-stream dynamic PTS shift
into the playlist origin, NOPTS dts repair, HEVC open-GOP CRA + leading
RASL B-frame drop. HDR / DV routing now respects the tvOS Match Content
master toggle. SDR rate-only display criteria (Match Frame Rate works
independently of Match Dynamic Range). HDR10+ runtime detection from T.35
SEI. Effective `videoFormat` clamped to panel capability.
([release notes](https://github.com/superuser404notfound/AetherEngine/releases/tag/1.1.0))

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-13

First stable release. Two coexisting playback pipelines (native AVPlayer
via local HLS-fMP4 loopback for HEVC / H.264 / native AV1; SW dav1d / VP9
through `AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer` for codecs AVPlayer's HLS-fMP4 path
rejects). HDR10 / HDR10+ / HLG / Dolby Vision Profile 5 / 8.1 / 8.4
support. Stream-copy passthrough for fMP4-legal audio codecs; AudioBridge
fallback for the rest. Bitmap + text subtitle decoder. LGPL-3.0 with App
Store exception.
